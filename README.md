# Rentaca - Ithaca Apartment Database

A comprehensive, student-friendly apartment and housing database for Ithaca, NY. This project aggregates rental information from multiple sources to help students find housing that meets their needs.

## Project Goal

Create the most complete apartment database for Ithaca by scraping and aggregating data from all available online sources.

### Sources currently scraped

| Source | Method | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Craigslist** (apts, rooms, sublets) | full detail-page scrape | Largest source; geo-coordinates, photos, amenities |
| **PPM Homes** | AppFolio listings portal | Live rents, bed/bath |
| **Travis Hyde Properties** | AppFolio listings portal | Live rents; manages **Eddygate** & **Seneca Way** |
| **Modern Living Rentals** | AppFolio listings portal | Large Collegetown portfolio |
| **Lambrou Real Estate** | Squarespace JSON API | Collegetown buildings |
| **Ithaca Estates Realty** | server-rendered detail pages | Multi-unit buildings |
| **Strawberry Property** | WordPress detail pages | Student houses |
| **Ridgetop** | Squarespace building pages | Eddy St / Dryden Rd |

AppFolio portals are discovered automatically and share one scraper
(`scrape_appfolio.py`); add a portal to `APPFOLIO_PORTALS` to include it.

### Sources investigated but not (yet) scrapable

| Source | Platform | Blocker |
|--------|----------|---------|
| apartments.com, Zillow | — | HTTP 403 anti-bot |
| Collegetown Terrace | — | HTTP 403 |
| Ithaca Renting Company | RentManager | HTML doesn't expose per-unit address/price; portal is JS-only |
| Lux & Lofts | Entrata | client-side rendered |
| Cayuga Place | RealPage | client-side rendered |
| Harold's Square | Buildium | client-side rendered |
| Heritage Park | greatcommunities portal | external portal |

To add a source, subclass `BaseScraper` in `scripts/` and register it in
`build_database.py`.

## How to Use This Data

### Interactive web interface (recommended)
Open `index.html` in a browser (or serve the folder) to browse every listing
on a map with live filters for price-per-person, bedrooms, bathrooms,
distance to Cornell, parking, laundry, A/C, furnished, and pets:
```
python -m http.server 8000      # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Search by Filters (CLI)
```
python tools/search.py --max-price 800 --bedrooms 2 --parking
```

### View Statistics
```
python tools/analyze.py --neighborhood collegetown
```

### Rebuild the database
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/build_database.py
```

### Access the JSON
All data is available in structured JSON format (`data/apartments.json`)
for direct analysis.
